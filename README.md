Bistromathique
==============



Make a Bistromathique with nice rules:

    - 25 lines per fonction
    - 5 fonctions per file
    - only malloc, free, read, write and ... nothing else
    - for is banned from the bistro
    - and more things like that

## Bistromathique work like that:

echo "math expr" | ./calc "base" "operator" "size of expr"

    ex: echo "50*10+(32-5+(856/50))" | ./calc "0123456789" "()+-*/%" "21"
